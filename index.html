                            <p>
                                I was born in 1996, I grew up in Dordrecht, The Netherlands. I got two older brothers. I have loved computers ever since I was 8 years old.
                                I've always enjoyed writing code and seeing what it would do and this led me to pursue computer science.
                                I studied Computer engineering before this but I didn't like working with the hardware so I quit and thats how I ended up to be a Software Engineering student.

                                I have a few hobbies/interests, first of all I love to play the piano,
                                I've been playing ever since I was 6 years old and I still play to this day. I practiced Judo and Karate
                                for years ever since I was a little boy. I also used to swim a lot as a child, I got all possible diploma's
                                available and I used to play football with one of my brothers.<br><br> I want to travel the world and practice my profession in a lot of different countries.
                                My interests lie in <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and <strong>AI</strong> also <strong>Game developement</strong> is
                                very interesting as well.<br><br> I hope I can find a job that allows me to learn while working and at the same time allows me to see a lot of the world and meet a lot of new wonderful people.

                                    This was my first project in the first year of my studies, I worked in a team of 4 others. Everyone made their own little minigame.
                                    Writtin in <strong>Python</strong> with <strong>PyGame</strong> it was a very fun project where I learned how to manage code with <strong>Git</strong>
                                    and a few of the basics of coding.

                                    In this project we had to make an application that vizualized data.
                                    We decided to make an app that could show all points of interest with help of the <strong>Google Places API</strong>
                                    We stored the API data locally and was refreshed after every search. This was my first time working with an <strong>API</strong>
                                    and it was pretty fun, I learned how to call an <strong>API</strong> and how to store/process that data.

                                    This was our 4th project and this was a pretty fun one, we were instructed to make an <strong>Android</strong> App, we decided on a scheduling app.
                                    We used <strong>Android Studio as an IDE</strong> and we wrote the App in <strong>Dart</strong> with the <strong>Flutter Framework</strong>.
                                    In this project I learned how to <strong>Prototype</strong> quickly and Flutter really supports this way of testing. I also got a better grasp on
                                    how you should actually structure your code for better <strong>readability</strong> and <strong>cleanliness</strong>.

                                    This project was really interesting because I was working with a lot of technologies I never worked with. My team and I were working with <strong>ASP.NET MVC</strong>
                                    , <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>. I also learned how to scrape data from websites and how to design well thought out <strong>databases</strong> with
                                    <strong>scalability</strong>in mind. I mostly worked on the <strong>Back-end</strong> so controllers, databse design and stuff like that.

                                    With a few friends I made during the <strong>Game Design & Development</strong> minor we started work on quest for redemption. The goal was to create a P2P MMO.
                                    It was a very ambitious project but we made good strides. The team quickly expanded and we regularly made devlogs and published them on the studio's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op2wC4UTpI4&list=PLIfdGCb8ul1KKNYd4z_kk66IKSTcOq_wR">Youtube Channel</a>.
                                    I have since left the project since I lost motivation for the project due to the direction it took and other reasons. I did learn a lot over the 5 months I worked on the game though.

                                    During this Minor periode I chose for the <strong>AI</strong> track<br />
                                    During the first half my teammate and I worked together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/roelbakker10/">Roel Bakker</a> on a
                                    Implementation of a well-known paper trying to intergrate <strong>ODE</strong> (ordinary differential equations) into neural nets. <br>
                                    Sadly, due to personal reasons Roel decided to leave the university and so my collegue and I needed to find another project to sink our teeth into.<br />

                                <p>
                                   During the second half of our Minor my teammate and I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/busal/">Tony Busker</a>
                                   to realize a <strong>Twitter Sentiment Analysis App</strong>, working with a collection of tweets on different subjects and returning the sentiment of said collection.
                                   This <strong>NLP</strong> application was realized in a traditional <strong>Machine Learning</strong> solution
                                   and a more advanced <strong>Deep learning</strong> solution.
                                   The <strong>DNN</strong> we designed made use of the <strong>LSTM</strong> architecture.
                                   We also made use of <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe</a> as another approach to the traditional
                                   Word2Vec approach.

                                <p>
                                    During this minor we made two games, one mobile and one 3D game. Our first game was called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.FatCatEntertainment.BoidsFish&hl=en_AU&gl=NL">A Boid's life</a>
                                    I was an <strong>artist</strong> on this project, which was a major challenge for me since I don't have an art background at all. I also composed the dynamic soundtrack.
                                    This was a lot of fun, I have a lot of experience with music so I took up the challenge and the soundtrack turned out awesome. Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zs5eilsECY">here!</a>
                                    I'm very proud of this OST since I only made it in a day with no prior knowledge on digital composing. I used Fruity Loops as my DAW and a lot of Spitfire VSTs.

                                <p>
                                   During the second half of this minor me and 15 other people worked on a game called <strong>Live Inc.</strong>, which is a 2v2 online co-op game. You can check it out on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1486620/Live_Inc/">Steam</a>.
                                    This was a fun project to work on since we got to work on a 3D game that we were actually going to publish on Steam. I was part of a 6 man strong Dev team. 
                                    I learned a lot about optimizing code and writing more object oriented.
                                    <br>
                                    This project made me want to make more games. After this project, me and a few friends from the minor went out to create an entirely different game called <strong>Quest For Redemption</strong>
                                    But you can read about that in the projects section.
